# Merge-Radix-Sort-Benchmarking
### This program creates the specified amount of data sets for each of the sizes and sorts them with the Radix and Merge sort classes. The data is written to a .txt file for use in Report.
Main creates random values for each set size, sorts them with the RadixSort and MergeSort classes, then calculates the time, critical operations and averages of the two. The Report class writes the values to Merge_Data.txt and Radix_Data.txt and displays the values in a table.

><h1>Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms</h1>
><h2>CMSC 451</h2>
><p>A presentation of fundamental techniques for designing and analyzing computer algorithms. The aim is to apply big-O estimates of algorithms and proof-of-correctness techniques and to design algorithms. Basic methods include divide-and-conquer techniques, search and traversal techniques, dynamic programming, greedy methods, and induction. Programming projects are included.</p>
